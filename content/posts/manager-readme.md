# Omar’s Working Principles

## Hello

My name is Omar, I'm an engineering lead. I've software engineer with over 20 years of professional experience.

## TL;DR

- I’m here to **remove roadblocks, clarify priorities, seek truth and help you grow** - while shipping excellent work at a sustainable pace.  
- I prefer **clear, direct communication** and **well-structured thinking** (TL; DR > bullets > essays, examples > abstractions).  
- I care a lot about **consistency, accountability and follow-through** - but I’m not precious about "my way."  
- If you’re stuck, **escalate early**. I’d rather help at minute 20 than learn about it on day 9.
- My default vibe: **pragmatic, calm, patient, curious, candid, and practical**.

## My role as your manager

My job is to create the conditions for you to do your best work. That means:
- **Clarity:** priorities, success criteria, filter our distractions, tradeoffs, and "what good looks like."
- **Momentum:** unblock decisions, reduce unnecessary threading, protect focus time.
- **Craft:** raise the bar in engineering quality and product thinking.
- **Growth:** help you build skills, confidence, visibility, and scope over time.
- **Collaboration**: you are not alone, I'm here to help and bounce ideas to.

### How I measure success

- You know what matters this week and why.
- You take ownership of your work.
- We ship meaningful outcomes - not just activity.
- Quality improves (reliability, maintainability, UX polish, operational health).
- You think about what's best for the customer. If something feels off, work towards making it right.
- You’re growing in scope/impact and can clearly articulate your wins.

---

## My operating principles (what I optimize for)

- **Pursue the truth.** Reality over vibes. Evidence over certainty.
- **Quality over quantity** Fewer things, done well, over doing many things.
- **Strong opinions, loosely held.** I’ll push for a direction, but I’ll change my mind with better info.
- **No hero culture.** Sustainable pace and healthy systems > last-minute rescues.
- **Make it easy to do the right thing.** Good defaults, automation, templates, documentation.
- **Help when needed**. Have an impetus to help your colleagues.
- **Progress over process**. Focus on moving forward while circumventing processes that hinder the delivery of work

---

## What you can expect from me

- I will be **direct, constructive and honest**, and I’ll do it with respect.
- I’ll help you **cut through ambiguity** (requirements, scope, sequencing).
- I’ll advocate for you-your impact, your growth, and your visibility.
- I’ll push for **high standards** (engineering and collaboration), and I’ll help you meet them.

---

## What I expect from you

- **Ownership:** bring problems + proposed paths, not just problems. Drive work to the finish line.
- **Transparency:** risks early, bad news early, unclear requirements early. Known unknowns, unknown unknowns.
- **Craft & pragmatism:** quality matters, but we choose the *right* level of quality for the moment.
- **Documentation habits:** decisions, tradeoffs, and "how to operate this thing" should live somewhere durable.
- **Consistency:** progress every week beats occasional sprints.

---

## Communication: how to work with me

### Defaults

- **Async by default.** Most things don’t need immediate responses.
- **Clarity > volume.** Short updates, clear asks, crisp context.

### The best way to message me

When you message, include:
1) What you need  
2) By when  
3) The smallest useful context  
4) Your recommendation (if you have one)
5) Tip: if your thoughts are unclear, follow the SBAR:
	1) Situation
	2) Background
	3) Assessment
	4) Recommendation

Example:
- "Need decision on A vs B today. Background: X constraint. A has limitations. I recommend B because Y."

### Meetings

- **I love an agenda-even 3 bullets.**
- If a meeting has no goal, it probably shouldn’t exist.
- I’ll interrupt (politely) to regain clarity if we’re drifting.
- *Please be patient with me, as I may be eager to jump-in and interrupt your train of thought*

---

## 1:1s (these are for you)

Your 1:1 is your time. We can cover:
- What’s going well / what’s not
- What’s draining you or slowing you down
- Feedback (both directions)
- Growth goals + current opportunities
- Bigger-picture career strategy and positioning

If you’re not sure what to bring, use this template:

- **Wins**
- **Stucks**
- **Risks**
- **Energy level**
- **Growth / next step**
- **Housekeeping items**

---

## Feedback (giving and receiving)

### How I give feedback

- Direct, specific, timely, and grounded in examples.
- I’ll focus on behavior + impact + next time.
- I'll try to provide constructive feedback, and suggestions on next steps.

### How I like to receive feedback

- Tell me quickly and clearly-especially if something I did created confusion or friction.
- If it’s sensitive, I prefer synchronous (so we don’t misread tone).
- I love honest feedback, especially critical feedback. I want to keep growing and improve. Help me by providing clarity so I can better help you.

---

## Decision-making & disagreement

- I value debate-**not debate-as-performance**.
- Disagree openly; align fully once we decide.
- If we’re stuck: we’ll timebox, define what we need to learn, and pick a reversible path when possible.

A phrase I use a lot:
- **"What can we do with this information?"**  
If the discussion isn’t leading to action, we tighten it up.

---

## Execution style (how I like work to flow)

- Define success criteria early (what does "done" mean?)
- Prefer small, shippable increments over giant launches.
- Working ahead as much as possible, avoid surprises.
- Reduce uncertainty fast: spikes, prototypes, proofs, quick user validation.
- If you’re spinning your wheels: pause, summarize what you tried, propose 2–3 next moves, and ping me.

---

## Career growth & performance

I’m proactive about growth. Expect me to ask:
- What scope do you want next?
- What skills are you trying to build this quarter?
- What work will create measurable impact and visibility?

I’ll help you translate your work into:
- outcomes, metrics, narratives, and promotion-ready artifacts.

---

## My quirks & pet peeves (so you don’t have to guess)
- I don’t love vague updates like "working on it." Tell me **what**, **what’s left**, and **what’s blocked**.
- I dislike surprise deadlines. If timelines are at risk, I want to know early.
- I’d rather you ask "dumb" questions than silently guess wrong for a week.
- I’m allergic to performative busyness. Outcomes > activity.

---

## How to get the best out of me
Bring me:
- Decisions that need unblocking
- Hard prioritization calls
- Ambiguous problems
- Career strategy questions
- Reviews of impact writeups / promos / resumes / narratives

If you want fast help, send:
- **Current state**
- **Goal**
- **Constraints**
- **What you tried**
- **Your best next step**

## About me (human stuff)

- Born and raised in Puerto Rico
- I’m a Jack of all Trades - I've done many skill areas in my career, where my curiosity drives me to learn many topics, at the sacrifice at becoming an expert at one.
- I'm not a serious person. I inject humor in my day-to-day. I'm making jokes at meetings and find opportunities to break any tension in discussions.
- I like structured learning, productivity hacks, consistent habits, game theory, and continuous improvement.
- Outside work:
	- I have a 7 year old daughter
	- I’m into music/DJ-ing, creative projects (art, creative coding)
	- Play basketball
	- Enjoy traveling to warm locations
